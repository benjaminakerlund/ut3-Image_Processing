	abstract = {Banana equivalent dose ({BED}) is an informal unit of measurement of ionizing radiation exposure, intended as a general educational example to compare a dose of radioactivity to the dose one is exposed to by eating one average-sized banana. Bananas contain naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, particularly potassium-40 (40K), one of several naturally occurring isotopes of potassium. One {BED} is often correlated to 10−7 sievert (0.1 μSv); however, in practice, this dose is not cumulative, as the potassium in foods is excreted in urine to maintain homeostasis. The {BED} is only meant as an educational exercise and is not a formally adopted dose measurement.},

	abstract = {This book explores the world of remote sensing technology, offering comprehensive insights into its principles, data acquisition methods, advanced processing techniques, and diverse applications. It covers the basics of remote sensing such as the foundational principles and data acquisition techniques, image pre-processing, such as noise removal, radiometric corrections, and image fusion, and advanced classification techniques like machine learning algorithms including neural networks and support vector machines. Finally, it discusses disaster management and agriculture, demonstrating how remote sensing methods are revolutionizing fields such as disaster response and agricultural monitoring. Professionals, researchers, and students involved in environmental sciences, geography, urban planning, and disaster management will benefit from these topics.},
